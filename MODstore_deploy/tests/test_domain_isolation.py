"""Domain-isolation guardrails.

The plan eventually splits the FastAPI monolith into multiple processes
(notification first, then knowledge, LLM, OpenAPI connectors, employees,
workflow). Once those services live in separate runtimes, the only legal
cross-module wiring is via:

* HTTP clients
* Domain events (NeuroBus + outbox)

The tests below pin a small but high-leverage subset of those rules to the
current monolith so refactors do not accidentally re-introduce the
``directly call into another domain`` shortcut. They are deliberately
narrower than ``test_neuro_ddd_boundaries`` because the legacy ``*_api``
modules are still allowed to live next to each other while we move them
under proper packages.
